# Content migrated to new site

Our OpenShift conventions and designs have moved to a new website. The [UXD Design Hub](https://www.uxd-hub) is a new tool that documents the work of our multi-displined team to support the larger ecosystem of Red Hat products. This OpenShift design site is no longer maintained and content is being migrated to the Design Hub.

# OpenShift Design

This site includes [designs](./designs), [conventions](./conventions), and [research](./research) related to the OpenShift Container Platform ecosystem. Most of this site is created and maintained by the [Red Hat User Experience Design team](https://www.redhat.com/en/about/product-design), but we welcome external contributions and suggestions.
